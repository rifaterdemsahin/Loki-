To check if `auth_enabled: false` is set in a running Loki instance on Minikube, follow these steps:

### 1. Access the Loki Pod:
First, identify the Loki pod running inside your Minikube cluster.

- List all the pods in the `monitoring` namespace:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n monitoring
    ```

@rifaterdemsahin âžœ /workspaces/loki (main) $ kubectl get pods -n monitoring
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
grafana-59fb4f95f7-rkzwp   1/1     Running   0             40m
loki-0                     1/1     Running   2 (67m ago)   104m
loki-promtail-x7hvz        1/1     Running   1 (69m ago)   104m

- Find the Loki pod in the list, and then access it using:

    ```bash
    kubectl exec -it loki-0  -n monitoring -- /bin/sh
    ```

    or if Bash is available:

    ```bash
    kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -n monitoring -- /bin/bash
    ```

### 2. Locate the Configuration File:
Once inside the Loki pod, you need to locate the `config.yaml` file, which stores the Loki configuration. Typically, it might be located in one of the following paths:

- `/etc/loki/`
- `/usr/local/etc/loki/`
- Check any custom paths used for your deployment

To locate the configuration file, use the `find` command:

```bash
find / -name config.yaml
```

### 3. Check the `auth_enabled` Setting:
Once you've located the configuration file, inspect it by using a command like `cat`, `vi`, or `nano`:

```bash
cat /path/to/config.yaml
```

Look for the following line in the file:

```yaml
auth_enabled: false
```

If this setting is missing or set to `true`, you may need to update it and restart the Loki pod for the changes to take effect.

### 4. Exit the Pod:
After checking or modifying the configuration, you can exit the Loki pod by typing:

```bash
exit
```

### 5. Restart the Loki Pod (if configuration is modified):
If you modified the configuration file, restart the Loki pod to apply the changes:

```bash
kubectl delete pod <pod_name> -n monitoring
```

Kubernetes will automatically recreate the pod with the updated configuration.
